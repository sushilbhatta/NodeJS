==> core concept of the expressJs
==> middleware allows to automatically pass the incoming request through a bunch of function by expressjs
==>this allows that the request handler will not have a single function handle all the request insted request handler will have
    multiple function to handle request until response is sent back.




important note about middleware
1..
never use next() after sending the response because we do not want to send two response to a same routes
2..
while using the use () function of express the never use '/' route at first because it is a default route and
if we use any random route starting with '/' route ,we will always get to '/' route. so make sure to use the '/' route at last .
eg;if we have sent webpage with content <h1>Welcome to Home page </h1> in route '/'
        we have another  webpage eith content <h2>History</h2> in route '/History'

        and if we have used home page at first ,Even if we go to '/History' route we will only get to "/" route.


    To avoid this problem always use the default route '/' at last.
